# Code Review Workshop #2

## Overview
The purpose of a code review workshop is to analzye our existing code review processes to collectively improve at both giving and receiving reviews. At Giant Machines, we work hard to ensure an inclusive and collaborative culture, and code reviews are an important part of that culture. Learning how to give helpful reviews takes time and practice, and we hope this workshop gives you meaningful improvement directions as you practice and grow.

## Review Analysis

1. **Most Useful:** Read through the review(s) you received in our previous code review workshop. Look for at least one (ideally two or three) comments that you found very helpful. What did you find helpful about them? 

2. **Questions:**  Read through the review(s) you received in our previous code review workshop. Look for one or two comments that you found less helpful or confusing. What would have helped them be clearer? 

## Small Group Shareout

In breakout groups, take turns sharing the reviews you received. Each person should share their screen with the review. They should share their most helpful comments and one or two comments they had questions about. 

## Whole Group Shareout

As a group, we'll share out the trends we saw in each room around what makes for helpful code review comments. Our goal during this time is to come up with a collective set of code review guidelines that we can use moving forward.
