# Code Review Workshop #1

## Overview
The purpose of a code review workshop is to practice reviewing others' code and receiving reviews on your own code. At Giant Machines, we work hard to ensure an inclusive and collaborative culture, and code reviews are an important part of that culture. As you review, we encourage you to make your tone and comments as positive as possible, since written communications can often come across more harshly than spoken communication. We'll use the reviews you conduct today as a tool for next week's workshop, where we'll build group norms around review practices. For now, we encourage you to do your best, and remember that the goal of this workshop is mutual growth.

## Agenda

- Welcome & Energizer (10 min)
- Code Review Framing (10 min)
- Review Time (35 min)
- Closing (5 min)

## Review Checklist

- [ ] **Acceptance criteria:** does the finished produce meet acceptance criteria and match designs within reason?
- [ ] **Readability:** are variables and functions named logically and following consistent conventions? Are comments used appropriately to make code more readable and digestible? Does the code follow familiar standard conventions?
- [ ] **DRY:** are there opportunities to refactor to reduce redundancy?
- [ ] **Performance:** are there opportunities to refactor to improve time and/or space complexity?

## Guidance

1. **Check-in (5 - 10 min):** Have a brief 5 - 10 minute check-in with your partner before you get started. Each person should answer the following questions to give your reviewer context:

   - What did you accomplish this week? What are you proud of?
   - What PRs/files should I be looking at for this week?
   - Is there any area of the [Review Checklist](#review-checklist) you particularly want feedback on, or refactors you already have in mind?

2. **Review (20 min):** Review your partner's code, using the [Review Checklist](#review-checklist) above. You should review through the Github reviewer tool. Aim to leave at least 5 affirming and 3 constructive comments. 

3. **Debrief (5 - 10 min):** Take time to read through the comments and address any questions that come out of these comments. Because reviews are often processed asynchronously, the goal is that all review comments are understandable in writing alone. This opportunity to ask questions and clarify is a chance to increase the learning opportunity as a reviewee, and get a sense of ways to write even clearer comments in the future for reviewers.
